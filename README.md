This project is a real-time hand gesture recognition system built with Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. It uses your computer’s webcam to detect your hand and then classifies different gestures into basic emotions.

👍 Thumbs Up → Happy

👎 Thumbs Down → Sad

✋ Open Palm → Calm

✊ Fist → Angry / Focused

✌️ V Sign → Excited

☝️ Index Only → Thinking

The program runs on any computer with Python installed. When you start it, a window will open showing your webcam feed. As you move your hand, the system draws the hand skeleton and displays the detected emotion label on screen in real time.

It’s a simple example of how computer vision and AI can be used to translate human body language into something a computer can understand. This project can be a starting point for more advanced applications like gesture-based control systems, interactive games, or accessibility tools.
